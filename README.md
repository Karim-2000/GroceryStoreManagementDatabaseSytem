Project Title: Grocery Store Management
Database System
Description: Our project involves designing a database system
for efficiently managing a grocery store's operations. Key entities
such as Customers, Products, Orders, Employees, Suppliers,
Discounts and Storage will be defined, each with relevant attributes
capturing essential information. Relationships between these entities
will be established to ensure data integrity and facilitate efficient data
retrieval. The goal is to create a flexible and scalable system that
streamlines operations and enhances overall efficiency.
